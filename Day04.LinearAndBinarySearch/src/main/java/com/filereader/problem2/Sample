Write a program that uses FileReader and BufferedReader to read a file and count how many times a specific word appears in the file.
Approach:
Create a FileReader to read from the file and wrap it in a BufferedReader.
Initialize a counter variable to keep track of word occurrences.
For each line in the file, split it into words and check if the target word exists.
Increment the counter each time the word is found.
Print the final count.
