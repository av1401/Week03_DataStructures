Best Practices
1. StringBuilder
Use when: You need to perform many string manipulations (e.g., concatenation, insertion) inside a loop or in a performance-sensitive scenario.
Best Practices:
Preferred over String for mutable strings in performance-critical code.
Use its append() method instead of concatenation using + for efficiency.
Initialize with a reasonable capacity to avoid resizing when the size is known in advance.
2. StringBuffer
Use when: Thread-safety is required while manipulating strings in multi-threaded environments.
Best Practices:
Use StringBuffer for thread-safe string manipulation when synchronization is necessary.
Avoid using StringBuffer in single-threaded environments if performance is a concern, as it’s slower than StringBuilder.
3. FileReader
Use when: You need to read character files (text files) efficiently.
Best Practices:
Always wrap FileReader with a BufferedReader for better performance when reading lines.
Handle IOExceptions properly.
Use FileReader for small files; for larger files, consider using streams like FileInputStream.
4. InputStreamReader
Use when: You need to convert byte streams into character streams (e.g., reading from non-text files or working with encodings).
Best Practices:
Wrap InputStreamReader with BufferedReader to enhance performance.
Always specify the correct charset to avoid encoding issues, especially for non-ASCII text.
Always close the reader using try-with-resources to avoid resource leakage.
5. Linear Search
Use when: Data is unsorted or small-sized, or when simplicity is preferred over performance.
Best Practices:
Return early: If the element is found, return immediately to avoid unnecessary checks.
Avoid using linear search on large data sets; consider binary search or hash-based approaches if performance is critical.
6. Binary Search
Use when: Data is already sorted, and you need an efficient search method.
Best Practices:
Ensure the list is sorted before using binary search.
Use recursive or iterative approaches as needed (iterative is generally preferred for better performance).
Always check for index bounds to avoid ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.
Implement binary search carefully, ensuring the middle index calculation avoids overflow: mid = low + (high - low) / 2 instead of mid = (low + high) / 2.


Problem Statements
StringBuilder Problem 1: Reverse a String Using StringBuilder
Problem:
Write a program that uses StringBuilder to reverse a given string. For example, if the input is "hello", the output should be "olleh".
Approach:
Create a new StringBuilder object.
Append the string to the StringBuilder.
Use the reverse() method of StringBuilder to reverse the string.
Convert the StringBuilder back to a string and return it.

package com.stringbuilder.problem1;

public class ReverseString {
   //Method to reverse string using string builder
   public static String reversedString(String string){
       StringBuilder builder = new StringBuilder(); // Create a string builder
       builder.append(string); // append string in string builder
       builder.reverse(); //reverse the string builder
       string = builder.toString(); // reconvert to string
       return string;
   }
   public static void main(String[] args) {
       String string = "Hello";
       System.out.println("Original String : " + string);
       System.out.print("Reversed String : " + reversedString(string));
   }
}



StringBuilder Problem 2: Remove Duplicates from a String Using StringBuilder
Problem:
Write a program that uses StringBuilder to remove all duplicate characters from a given string while maintaining the original order.
Approach:
Initialize an empty StringBuilder and a HashSet to keep track of characters.
Iterate over each character in the string:
If the character is not in the HashSet, append it to the StringBuilder and add it to the HashSet.
Return the StringBuilder as a string without duplicates.
package com.stringbuilder.problem2;

import java.util.HashSet;

public class RemoveDuplicates {
   //Method to remove duplicates
   public static String removeDuplicates(String string) {
       StringBuilder builder = new StringBuilder(); // Create a StringBuilder
       HashSet<Character> occurred = new HashSet<>();//Create a hash map
       for (char c : string.toCharArray()) {
           if (!occurred.contains(c)) { // check whether the character is in hash map or not
               builder.append(c);  // if not present add to string builder
               occurred.add(c); // then add to hash map
           }
       }
       return builder.toString();
   }

   public static void main(String[] args) {
       String string = "MALAYALLAM";
       System.out.println("Original String : " + string);
       String result = removeDuplicates(string);
       System.out.println("String after removing duplicates: " + result);
   }
}





StringBuffer Problem 1: Concatenate Strings Efficiently Using StringBuffer
Problem:
You are given an array of strings. Write a program that uses StringBuffer to concatenate all the strings in the array efficiently.
Approach:
Create a new StringBuffer object.
Iterate through each string in the array and append it to the StringBuffer.
Return the concatenated string after the loop finishes.
Using StringBuffer ensures efficient string concatenation due to its mutable nature.

package com.stringbuffer.problem1;

public class Concatination {
   public static void concatinate(String[] strings){
       StringBuffer buffer = new StringBuffer(); //create a string buffer
       for(String string : strings){ // check each string in string array
           buffer.append(string); //add the string in string buffer
           buffer.append(" "); // add a space between each string in the array
       }
       System.out.println(buffer);
   }
   public static void main(String[] args) {
       String[] strings = {"Hello" , "how" , "are" , "you", "?"}; // create a string array
       concatinate(strings);
   }
}



StringBuffer Problem 2: Compare StringBuffer with StringBuilder for String Concatenation
Problem:
Write a program that compares the performance of StringBuffer and StringBuilder for concatenating strings. For large datasets (e.g., concatenating 1 million strings), compare the execution time of both classes.
Approach:
Initialize two StringBuffer and StringBuilder objects.
Perform string concatenation in both objects, appending 1 million strings (e.g., "hello").
Measure the time taken to complete the concatenation using System.nanoTime() for both StringBuffer and StringBuilder.
Output the time taken by both classes for comparison.
package com.stringbuffer.problem2;

public class Comparision {
   public static void compareTime(StringBuilder builderobj , StringBuffer bufferobj){

       StringBuffer stringBuffer = new StringBuffer(); // create a string buffer
       int appends = 1000000;
       String string = "hello";
       long startTime = System.nanoTime(); // check time before appending
       for (int i = 0; i < appends; i++) { //append the string in buffer
           stringBuffer.append(string);
       }
       long endTime = System.nanoTime(); // check time after appending
       long stringBufferTime = endTime - startTime; // calculate the time taken
       System.out.println("Time taken by StringBuffer: " + stringBufferTime + " ns");

       // Measure time for StringBuilder
       StringBuilder stringBuilder = new StringBuilder();
       startTime = System.nanoTime(); // check time before appending
       for (int i = 0; i < appends; i++) { //append the string in builder
           stringBuilder.append(string);
       }
       endTime = System.nanoTime(); // check time after appending
       long stringBuilderTime = endTime - startTime; // calculate the time taken
       System.out.println("Time taken by StringBuilder: " + stringBuilderTime + " ns");

       // Compare results
       if (stringBuilderTime < stringBufferTime) {
           System.out.println("StringBuilder is faster.");
       } else {
           System.out.println("StringBuffer is faster.");
       }
   }
   public static void main(String[] args) {
       // create two object each for String builder and String Buffer
       StringBuilder builder = new StringBuilder();
       StringBuffer buffer = new StringBuffer();

       //Call the method to compare
       compareTime(builder, buffer);
   }
}




FileReader Problem 1: Read a File Line by Line Using FileReader
Problem:
Write a program that uses FileReader to read a text file line by line and print each line to the console.
Approach:
Create a FileReader object to read from the file.
Wrap the FileReader in a BufferedReader to read lines efficiently.
Use a loop to read each line using the readLine() method and print it to the console.
Close the file after reading all the lines.

package com.FileReader.problem1;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;

public class ReadLine {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
       try (FileReader fr = new FileReader("C:\\Users\\abhishek vishwakarma\\Desktop\\Capgemini\\Week03_DataStructures\\Day04.LinearAndBinarySearch\\src\\main\\java\\com\\FileReader\\problem1\\Text")) {
           int i;
           while ((i = fr.read()) != -1) {
               System.out.print((char) i);  // Reads and prints the file's characters
           }
       } catch (IOException e) {
           e.printStackTrace();
       }
   }
}



FileReader Problem 2: Count the Occurrence of a Word in a File Using FileReader:
ProblemWrite a program that uses FileReader and BufferedReader to read a file and count how many times a specific word appears in the file.
Approach:
Create a FileReader to read from the file and wrap it in a BufferedReader.
Initialize a counter variable to keep track of word occurrences.
For each line in the file, split it into words and check if the target word exists.
Increment the counter each time the word is found.
Print the final count.
package com.filereader.problem2;

import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.IOException;

public class CountOccurence {
   public static void main(String[] args) {

       //Define the file path
       String filePath = "C:\\Users\\abhishek vishwakarma\\Desktop\\Capgemini\\Week03_DataStructures\\Day04.LinearAndBinarySearch\\src\\main\\java\\com\\FileReader\\problem2\\Sample";
       String targetWord = "a"; // provide word which you want to search
       int count = 0;

       try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(filePath))) {
           String line;
           while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {
               if (line.contains(targetWord)) { // check whether the word is in file or not
                   count++;
               }
           }
       } catch (IOException e) { // If file is not present
           System.out.println("File not found or error in reading file.");
       }

       System.out.println("The word \"" + targetWord + "\" appears " + count + " times in the file.");
   }
}



InputStreamReader Problem 1: Convert Byte Stream to Character Stream Using InputStreamReader
Problem:
Write a program that uses InputStreamReader to read binary data from a file and print it as characters. The file contains data encoded in a specific charset (e.g., UTF-8).
Approach:
Create a FileInputStream object to read the binary data from the file.
Wrap the FileInputStream in an InputStreamReader to convert the byte stream into a character stream.
Use a BufferedReader to read characters efficiently from the InputStreamReader.
Read the file line by line and print the characters to the console.
Handle any encoding exceptions as needed.

package com.inputstreamreader.problem1;

import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.FileInputStream;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;
import java.io.IOException;


public class ByteSteamToCharacterStream {


   public static void main(String[] args) {
       //Provide path of the file
       String filePath = "C:\\Users\\abhishek vishwakarma\\Desktop\\Capgemini\\Week03_DataStructures\\Day04.LinearAndBinarySearch\\src\\main\\java\\com\\inputstreamreader\\problem1\\Sample";
       try (FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(filePath);
            InputStreamReader isr = new InputStreamReader(fis, "UTF-8");  // Convert bytes to characters
            BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(isr)) {  // Read characters efficiently

           String line;
           while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {
               System.out.println(line); // Print each line
           }

       } catch (IOException e) {
           e.printStackTrace();
       }
   }
}




InputStreamReader Problem 2: Read User Input and Write to File Using InputStreamReader
Problem:
Write a program that uses InputStreamReader to read user input from the console and write the input to a file. Each input should be written as a new line in the file.
Approach:
Create an InputStreamReader to read from System.in (the console).
Wrap the InputStreamReader in a BufferedReader for efficient reading.
Create a FileWriter to write to the file.
Read user input using readLine() and write the input to the file.
Repeat the process until the user enters "exit" to stop inputting.
Close the file after the input is finished.
package com.inputstreamreader.problem2;

import java.io.*;

public class WriteInFile {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
       String filePath = "C:\\Users\\abhishek vishwakarma\\Desktop\\Capgemini\\Week03_DataStructures\\Day04.LinearAndBinarySearch\\src\\main\\java\\com\\inputstreamreader\\problem2\\WriteInFile";
       try (InputStreamReader isr = new InputStreamReader(System.in);
            BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(isr);
            FileWriter fw = new FileWriter(filePath, true); // Append mode
            BufferedWriter bw = new BufferedWriter(fw)) {

           System.out.println("Enter text (type 'exit' to stop):");

           String line;
           while (!(line = br.readLine()).equalsIgnoreCase("exit")) {
               bw.write(line);
               bw.newLine(); // Write input as a new line in the file
           }

           System.out.println("User input saved to " + filePath);

       }
       catch(IOException e){
           e.printStackTrace();
       }
   }
}




Challenge Problem: Compare StringBuilder, StringBuffer, FileReader, and InputStreamReader
Problem:
Write a program that:
Uses StringBuilder and StringBuffer to concatenate a list of strings 1,000,000 times.
Uses FileReader and InputStreamReader to read a large file (e.g., 100MB) and print the number of words in the file.
Approach:
StringBuilder and StringBuffer:
Create a list of strings (e.g., "hello").
Concatenate the strings 1,000,000 times using both StringBuilder and StringBuffer.
Measure and compare the time taken for each.
FileReader and InputStreamReader:
Read a large text file (100MB) using FileReader and InputStreamReader.
Count the number of words by splitting the text on whitespace characters.
Print the word count and compare the time taken for reading the file.


Linear Search Problem 1: Search for the First Negative Number
Problem:
You are given an integer array. Write a program that performs Linear Search to find the first negative number in the array. If a negative number is found, return its index. If no negative number is found, return -1.
Approach:
Iterate through the array from the start.
Check if the current element is negative.
If a negative number is found, return its index.
If the loop completes without finding a negative number, return -1.

Linear Search Problem 2: Search for a Specific Word in a List of Sentences
Problem:
You are given an array of sentences (strings). Write a program that performs Linear Search to find the first sentence containing a specific word. If the word is found, return the sentence. If no sentence contains the word, return "Not Found".
Approach:
Iterate through the list of sentences.
For each sentence, check if it contains the specific word.
If the word is found, return the current sentence.
If no sentence contains the word, return "Not Found".

Binary Search Problem 1: Find the Rotation Point in a Rotated Sorted Array
Problem:
You are given a rotated sorted array. Write a program that performs Binary Search to find the index of the smallest element in the array (the rotation point).
Approach:
Initialize left as 0 and right as n - 1.
Perform a binary search:
Find the middle element mid = (left + right) / 2.
If arr[mid] > arr[right], then the smallest element is in the right half, so update left = mid + 1.
If arr[mid] < arr[right], the smallest element is in the left half, so update right = mid.
Continue until left equals right, and then return arr[left] (the rotation point).

Binary Search Problem 2: Find the Peak Element in an Array
Problem:
A peak element is an element that is greater than its neighbors. Write a program that performs Binary Search to find a peak element in an array. If there are multiple peak elements, return any one of them.
Approach:
Initialize left as 0 and right as n - 1.
Perform a binary search:
Find the middle element mid = (left + right) / 2.
If arr[mid] > arr[mid - 1] and arr[mid] > arr[mid + 1], arr[mid] is a peak element.
If arr[mid] < arr[mid - 1], then search the left half, updating right = mid - 1.
If arr[mid] < arr[mid + 1], then search the right half, updating left = mid + 1.
Continue until a peak element is found.

Binary Search Problem 3: Search for a Target Value in a 2D Sorted Matrix
Problem:
You are given a 2D matrix where each row is sorted in ascending order, and the first element of each row is greater than the last element of the previous row. Write a program that performs Binary Search to find a target value in the matrix. If the value is found, return true. Otherwise, return false.
Approach:
Treat the matrix as a 1D array (flattened version).
Initialize left as 0 and right as rows * columns - 1.
Perform binary search:
Find the middle element index mid = (left + right) / 2.
Convert mid to row and column indices using row = mid / numColumns and col = mid % numColumns.
Compare the middle element with the target:
If it matches, return true.
If the target is smaller, search the left half by updating right = mid - 1.
If the target is larger, search the right half by updating left = mid + 1.
If the element is not found, return false.

Binary Search Problem 4: Find the First and Last Occurrence of an Element in a Sorted Array
Problem:
Given a sorted array and a target element, write a program that uses Binary Search to find the first and last occurrence of the target element in the array. If the element is not found, return -1.
Approach:
Use binary search to find the first occurrence:
Perform a regular binary search, but if the target is found, continue searching on the left side (right = mid - 1) to find the first occurrence.
Use binary search to find the last occurrence:
Similar to finding the first occurrence, but once the target is found, continue searching on the right side (left = mid + 1) to find the last occurrence.
Return the indices of the first and last occurrence. If not found, return -1.

Challenge Problem (for both Linear and Binary Search)
Problem:
You are given a list of integers. Write a program that uses Linear Search to find the first missing positive integer in the list and Binary Search to find the index of a given target number.
Approach:
Linear Search for the first missing positive integer:
Iterate through the list and mark each number in the list as visited (you can use negative marking or a separate array).
Traverse the array again to find the first positive integer that is not marked.
Binary Search for the target index:
After sorting the array, perform binary search to find the index of the given target number.
Return the index if found, otherwise return -1.

BufferedReader in Java
BufferedReader is a Java class in the java.io package that reads text from an input stream efficiently. It buffers the input to improve performance, making it faster than reading characters one by one.

Key Features:
Reads text efficiently from an input stream.
Supports reading a single character, an array of characters, or an entire line.
Commonly used with FileReader or InputStreamReader.

Example 1: Reading a File using BufferedReader
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;

public class BufferedReaderExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String filePath = "sample.txt"; // Ensure the file exists in the project directory

        try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(filePath))) {
            String line;
            while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) { // Read line by line
                System.out.println(line);
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}


Explanation:
Uses FileReader to read from a file.
BufferedReader reads the file line by line using readLine().
The try-with-resources statement automatically closes the reader after execution.

Example 2: Reading User Input from Console
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;

public class ConsoleInputExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in))) {
            System.out.print("Enter your name: ");
            String name = br.readLine();  // Reads input from the user
            System.out.println("Hello, " + name + "!");
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}

Explanation:
Uses InputStreamReader(System.in) with BufferedReader to read user input from the console.
readLine() captures the entire input line as a String.

Advantages of BufferedReader
✔ Efficient: Reads larger chunks of data at once, reducing I/O overhead.
✔ Flexible: Can read from files, console, or any input stream.
✔ Thread-safe: Can be synchronized if needed.


FileReader and InputStreamReader
Both FileReader and InputStreamReader are classes in the java.io package that are used to read data from files or other input streams. However, there are differences in their usage and underlying mechanisms.
FileReader
Purpose: Specifically used to read characters from files.
Internals: It is a character stream that makes reading character files easier.
Encoding: It assumes the default character encoding of the system, which can cause issues if you need to handle non-default encodings.
Constructor:
FileReader(String fileName) throws FileNotFoundException
FileReader(File file) throws FileNotFoundException

Example:
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;

public class FileReaderExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (FileReader fr = new FileReader("example.txt")) {
            int i;
            while ((i = fr.read()) != -1) {
                System.out.print((char) i);  // Reads and prints the file's characters
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}


Key Points of FileReader:
Efficient for reading text files.
Character stream: Reads data as characters, so it’s ideal for text-based files (e.g., .txt, .xml).
Not flexible for binary streams (like images, audio files).

InputStreamReader
Purpose: Converts byte streams into character streams, making it useful when dealing with input streams (like reading from a file or network socket) that provide byte data.
Internals: It is a bridge between byte streams and character streams, and it can be used with any InputStream (e.g., FileInputStream, BufferedInputStream).
Encoding: Allows specifying the character encoding (e.g., UTF-8, ISO-8859-1), which makes it more flexible than FileReader.
Constructor:
InputStreamReader(InputStream in) throws UnsupportedEncodingException
InputStreamReader(InputStream in, String encoding) throws UnsupportedEncodingException

Example:
import java.io.FileInputStream;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;
import java.io.IOException;

public class InputStreamReaderExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (InputStreamReader isr = new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream("example.txt"), "UTF-8")) {
            int i;
            while ((i = isr.read()) != -1) {
                System.out.print((char) i);  // Reads the characters from the file with specified encoding
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}

Key Points of InputStreamReader:
Converts byte streams to character streams.
You can specify the character encoding when reading data (e.g., UTF-8).
More flexible than FileReader, as it can be used with any InputStream.

Comparison: FileReader vs InputStreamReader
Feature
FileReader
InputStreamReader
Purpose
Reads characters from files
Converts byte stream to character stream
Input Type
Directly reads from files
Works with any InputStream (e.g., files, sockets)
Encoding
Uses system default encoding
Can specify custom encoding (e.g., UTF-8)
Flexibility
Limited to file-based character streams
More flexible, works with byte streams
Usage
Best for text files in the default encoding
Best when you need control over encoding or work with various input sources


Which One to Use?
Use FileReader when reading from text files and the system's default encoding is sufficient.
Use InputStreamReader when:
You need to read from byte streams (e.g., FileInputStream, network streams).
You need to specify a custom encoding (e.g., UTF-8 or UTF-16).

Internals: It is a character stream that makes reading character files easier.
Encoding: It assumes the default character encoding of the system, which can cause issues if you need to handle non-default encodings.
Constructor:
FileReader(String fileName) throws FileNotFoundException
FileReader(File file) throws FileNotFoundException

Example:
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;

public class FileReaderExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (FileReader fr = new FileReader("example.txt")) {
            int i;
            while ((i = fr.read()) != -1) {
                System.out.print((char) i);  // Reads and prints the file's characters
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}


Key Points of FileReader:
Efficient for reading text files.
Character stream: Reads data as characters, so it’s ideal for text-based files (e.g., .txt, .xml).
Not flexible for binary streams (like images, audio files).

InputStreamReader
Purpose: Converts byte streams into character streams, making it useful when dealing with input streams (like reading from a file or network socket) that provide byte data.
Internals: It is a bridge between byte streams and character streams, and it can be used with any InputStream (e.g., FileInputStream, BufferedInputStream).
Encoding: Allows specifying the character encoding (e.g., UTF-8, ISO-8859-1), which makes it more flexible than FileReader.
Constructor:
InputStreamReader(InputStream in) throws UnsupportedEncodingException
InputStreamReader(InputStream in, String encoding) throws UnsupportedEncodingException

Example:
import java.io.FileInputStream;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;
import java.io.IOException;

public class InputStreamReaderExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (InputStreamReader isr = new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream("example.txt"), "UTF-8")) {
            int i;
            while ((i = isr.read()) != -1) {
                System.out.print((char) i);  // Reads the characters from the file with specified encoding
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}

Key Points of InputStreamReader:
Converts byte streams to character streams.
You can specify the character encoding when reading data (e.g., UTF-8).
More flexible than FileReader, as it can be used with any InputStream.

Comparison: FileReader vs InputStreamReader
Feature
FileReader
InputStreamReader
Purpose
Reads characters from files
Converts byte stream to character stream
Input Type
Directly reads from files
Works with any InputStream (e.g., files, sockets)
Encoding
Uses system default encoding
Can specify custom encoding (e.g., UTF-8)
Flexibility

Best when you need control over encoding or work with various input sources


Which One to Use?
Use FileReader when reading from text files and the system's default encoding is sufficient.
Use InputStreamReader when:
You need to read from byte streams (e.g., FileInputStream, network streams).
You need to specify a custom encoding (e.g., UTF-8 or UTF-16).

BufferedReader in Java
BufferedReader is a Java class in the java.io package that reads text from an input stream efficiently. It buffers the input to improve performance, making it faster than reading characters one by one.

Key Features:
Reads text efficiently from an input stream.
Supports reading a single character, an array of characters, or an entire line.
Commonly used with FileReader or InputStreamReader.

Example 1: Reading a File using BufferedReader
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;

public class BufferedReaderExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String filePath = "sample.txt"; // Ensure the file exists in the project directory

        try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(filePath))) {
            String line;
            while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) { // Read line by line
                System.out.println(line);
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}


Explanation:
Uses FileReader to read from a file.
BufferedReader reads the file line by line using readLine().
The try-with-resources statement automatically closes the reader after execution.

Example 2: Reading User Input from Console
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;

public class ConsoleInputExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in))) {
            System.out.print("Enter your name: ");
            String name = br.readLine();  // Reads input from the user
            System.out.println("Hello, " + name + "!");
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}

Explanation:
Uses InputStreamReader(System.in) with BufferedReader to read user input from the console.
readLine() captures the entire input line as a String.

Advantages of BufferedReader
✔ Efficient: Reads larger chunks of data at once, reducing I/O overhead.
✔ Flexible: Can read from files, console, or any input stream.
✔ Thread-safe: Can be synchronized if needed.

            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}


Explanation:
Uses FileReader to read from a file.
BufferedReader reads the file line by line using readLine().
The try-with-resources statement automatically closes the reader after execution.

Example 2: Reading User Input from Console
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;

public class ConsoleInputExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in))) {
            System.out.print("Enter your name: ");
            String name = br.readLine();  // Reads input from the user
            System.out.println("Hello, " + name + "!");
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}

Explanation:
Uses InputStreamReader(System.in) with BufferedReader to read user input from the console.
readLine() captures the entire input line as a String.

Advantages of BufferedReader
✔ Efficient: Reads larger chunks of data at once, reducing I/O overhead.
✔ Flexible: Can read from files, console, or any input stream.
✔ Thread-safe: Can be synchronized if needed.


FileReader and InputStreamReader
Both FileReader and InputStreamReader are classes in the java.io package that are used to read data from files or other input streams. However, there are differences in their usage and underlying mechanisms.
FileReader
Purpose: Specifically used to read characters from files.
Internals: It is a character stream that makes reading character files easier.
Encoding: It assumes the default character encoding of the system, which can cause issues if you need to handle non-default encodings.
Constructor:
FileReader(String fileName) throws FileNotFoundException
FileReader(File file) throws FileNotFoundException

Example:
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;

public class FileReaderExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (FileReader fr = new FileReader("example.txt")) {
            int i;
            while ((i = fr.read()) != -1) {
                System.out.print((char) i);  // Reads and prints the file's characters
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}


Key Points of FileReader:
Efficient for reading text files.
Character stream: Reads data as characters, so it’s ideal for text-based files (e.g., .txt, .xml).
Not flexible for binary streams (like images, audio files).

InputStreamReader
Purpose: Converts byte streams into character streams, making it useful when dealing with input streams (like reading from a file or network socket) that provide byte data.
Internals: It is a bridge between byte streams and character streams, and it can be used with any InputStream (e.g., FileInputStream, BufferedInputStream).
Encoding: Allows specifying the character encoding (e.g., UTF-8, ISO-8859-1), which makes it more flexible than FileReader.
Constructor:
InputStreamReader(InputStream in) throws UnsupportedEncodingException
InputStreamReader(InputStream in, String encoding) throws UnsupportedEncodingException

Example:
import java.io.FileInputStream;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;
import java.io.IOException;

public class InputStreamReaderExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (InputStreamReader isr = new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream("example.txt"), "UTF-8")) {
            int i;
            while ((i = isr.read()) != -1) {
                System.out.print((char) i);  // Reads the characters from the file with specified encoding
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}

Key Points of InputStreamReader:
Converts byte streams to character streams.
You can specify the character encoding when reading data (e.g., UTF-8).
More flexible than FileReader, as it can be used with any InputStream.

Comparison: FileReader vs InputStreamReader
Feature
FileReader
InputStreamReader
Purpose
Reads characters from files
Converts byte stream to character stream
Input Type

Which One to Use?
Use FileReader when reading from text files and the system's default encoding is sufficient.
Use InputStreamReader when:
You need to read from byte streams (e.g., FileInputStream, network streams).
You need to specify a custom encoding (e.g., UTF-8 or UTF-16).

BufferedReader in Java
BufferedReader is a Java class in the java.io package that reads text from an input stream efficiently. It buffers the input to improve performance, making it faster than reading characters one by one.

Key Features:
Reads text efficiently from an input stream.
Supports reading a single character, an array of characters, or an entire line.
Commonly used with FileReader or InputStreamReader.

        try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(filePath))) {
            String line;
            while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) { // Read line by line
                System.out.println(line);
            }

Works with any InputStream (e.g., files, sockets)
Encoding
Uses system default encoding
Can specify custom encoding (e.g., UTF-8)
Flexibility
Limited to file-based character streams
More flexible, works with byte streams
Usage
Best for text files in the default encoding
Best when you need control over encoding or work with various input sources


Which One to Use?
Use FileReader when reading from text files and the system's default encoding is sufficient.
Use InputStreamReader when:
You need to read from byte streams (e.g., FileInputStream, network streams).
You need to specify a custom encoding (e.g., UTF-8 or UTF-16).

BufferedReader in Java
BufferedReader is a Java class in the java.io package that reads text from an input stream efficiently. It buffers the input to improve performance, making it faster than reading characters one by one.

Key Features:
Reads text efficiently from an input stream.
Supports reading a single character, an array of characters, or an entire line.
Commonly used with FileReader or InputStreamReader.

Example 1: Reading a File using BufferedReader
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;

public class BufferedReaderExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String filePath = "sample.txt"; // Ensure the file exists in the project directory

        try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(filePath))) {
            String line;
            while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) { // Read line by line
                System.out.println(line);
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}


Explanation:
Uses FileReader to read from a file.
BufferedReader reads the file line by line using readLine().
The try-with-resources statement automatically closes the reader after execution.

Example 2: Reading User Input from Console
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;

public class ConsoleInputExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in))) {
            System.out.print("Enter your name: ");
            String name = br.readLine();  // Reads input from the user
            System.out.println("Hello, " + name + "!");
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}

Explanation:
Uses InputStreamReader(System.in) with BufferedReader to read user input from the console.
readLine() captures the entire input line as a String.

Advantages of BufferedReader
✔ Efficient: Reads larger chunks of data at once, reducing I/O overhead.
✔ Flexible: Can read from files, console, or any input stream.
✔ Thread-safe: Can be synchronized if needed.


FileReader and InputStreamReader
Both FileReader and InputStreamReader are classes in the java.io package that are used to read data from files or other input streams. However, there are differences in their usage and underlying mechanisms.
FileReader
Purpose: Specifically used to read characters from files.
Internals: It is a character stream that makes reading character files easier.
Encoding: It assumes the default character encoding of the system, which can cause issues if you need to handle non-default encodings.
Constructor:
FileReader(String fileName) throws FileNotFoundException
FileReader(File file) throws FileNotFoundException

Example:
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;

public class FileReaderExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (FileReader fr = new FileReader("example.txt")) {
            int i;
            while ((i = fr.read()) != -1) {
                System.out.print((char) i);  // Reads and prints the file's characters
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}


Key Points of FileReader:
Efficient for reading text files.
Character stream: Reads data as characters, so it’s ideal for text-based files (e.g., .txt, .xml).
Not flexible for binary streams (like images, audio files).

InputStreamReader
Purpose: Converts byte streams into character streams, making it useful when dealing with input streams (like reading from a file or network socket) that provide byte data.
Internals: It is a bridge between byte streams and character streams, and it can be used with any InputStream (e.g., FileInputStream, BufferedInputStream).
Encoding: Allows specifying the character encoding (e.g., UTF-8, ISO-8859-1), which makes it more flexible than FileReader.
Constructor:
InputStreamReader(InputStream in) throws UnsupportedEncodingException
InputStreamReader(InputStream in, String encoding) throws UnsupportedEncodingException

Example:
import java.io.FileInputStream;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;
import java.io.IOException;

public class InputStreamReaderExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (InputStreamReader isr = new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream("example.txt"), "UTF-8")) {
            int i;
            while ((i = isr.read()) != -1) {
                System.out.print((char) i);  // Reads the characters from the file with specified encoding
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}

Key Points of InputStreamReader:
Converts byte streams to character streams.
You can specify the character encoding when reading data (e.g., UTF-8).
More flexible than FileReader, as it can be used with any InputStream.

Purpose: Converts byte streams into character streams, making it useful when dealing with input streams (like reading from a file or network socket) that provide byte data.
Internals: It is a bridge between byte streams and character streams, and it can be used with any InputStream (e.g., FileInputStream, BufferedInputStream).
Encoding: Allows specifying the character encoding (e.g., UTF-8, ISO-8859-1), which makes it more flexible than FileReader.
Constructor:
InputStreamReader(InputStream in) throws UnsupportedEncodingException
InputStreamReader(InputStream in, String encoding) throws UnsupportedEncodingException

Example:
import java.io.FileInputStream;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;
import java.io.IOException;

public class InputStreamReaderExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (InputStreamReader isr = new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream("example.txt"), "UTF-8")) {
            int i;
            while ((i = isr.read()) != -1) {
                System.out.print((char) i);  // Reads the characters from the file with specified encoding
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}

Key Points of InputStreamReader:
Converts byte streams to character streams.
You can specify the character encoding when reading data (e.g., UTF-8).
More flexible than FileReader, as it can be used with any InputStream.

You need to read from byte streams (e.g., FileInputStream, network streams).
You need to specify a custom encoding (e.g., UTF-8 or UTF-16).

BufferedReader in Java
BufferedReader is a Java class in the java.io package that reads text from an input stream efficiently. It buffers the input to improve performance, making it faster than reading characters one by one.

Key Features:
Reads text efficiently from an input stream.
Supports reading a single character, an array of characters, or an entire line.
Commonly used with FileReader or InputStreamReader.

Example 1: Reading a File using BufferedReader
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;

public class BufferedReaderExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String filePath = "sample.txt"; // Ensure the file exists in the project directory

        try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(filePath))) {
            String line;
            while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) { // Read line by line
                System.out.println(line);
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}


Explanation:
Uses FileReader to read from a file.
BufferedReader reads the file line by line using readLine().
The try-with-resources statement automatically closes the reader after execution.

Example 2: Reading User Input from Console
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;

public class ConsoleInputExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in))) {
            System.out.print("Enter your name: ");
            String name = br.readLine();  // Reads input from the user
            System.out.println("Hello, " + name + "!");
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}

Explanation:
Uses InputStreamReader(System.in) with BufferedReader to read user input from the console.
readLine() captures the entire input line as a String.

Advantages of BufferedReader
✔ Efficient: Reads larger chunks of data at once, reducing I/O overhead.
✔ Flexible: Can read from files, console, or any input stream.
✔ Thread-safe: Can be synchronized if needed.


FileReader and InputStreamReader
Both FileReader and InputStreamReader are classes in the java.io package that are used to read data from files or other input streams. However, there are differences in their usage and underlying mechanisms.
FileReader
Purpose: Specifically used to read characters from files.

FileReader and InputStreamReader
Both FileReader and InputStreamReader are classes in the java.io package that are used to read data from files or other input streams. However, there are differences in their usage and underlying mechanisms.
FileReader
Purpose: Specifically used to read characters from files.
Internals: It is a character stream that makes reading character files easier.
Encoding: It assumes the default character encoding of the system, which can cause issues if you need to handle non-default encodings.
Constructor:
FileReader(String fileName) throws FileNotFoundException
FileReader(File file) throws FileNotFoundException

Example:
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;

public class FileReaderExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (FileReader fr = new FileReader("example.txt")) {
            int i;
            while ((i = fr.read()) != -1) {
                System.out.print((char) i);  // Reads and prints the file's characters
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}


Key Points of FileReader:
Efficient for reading text files.
Character stream: Reads data as characters, so it’s ideal for text-based files (e.g., .txt, .xml).
Not flexible for binary streams (like images, audio files).

InputStreamReader
Purpose: Converts byte streams into character streams, making it useful when dealing with input streams (like reading from a file or network socket) that provide byte data.
Internals: It is a bridge between byte streams and character streams, and it can be used with any InputStream (e.g., FileInputStream, BufferedInputStream).
Encoding: Allows specifying the character encoding (e.g., UTF-8, ISO-8859-1), which makes it more flexible than FileReader.
Constructor:
InputStreamReader(InputStream in) throws UnsupportedEncodingException
InputStreamReader(InputStream in, String encoding) throws UnsupportedEncodingException

Example:
import java.io.FileInputStream;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;
import java.io.IOException;

public class InputStreamReaderExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (InputStreamReader isr = new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream("example.txt"), "UTF-8")) {
            int i;
            while ((i = isr.read()) != -1) {
                System.out.print((char) i);  // Reads the characters from the file with specified encoding
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}

Key Points of InputStreamReader:
Converts byte streams to character streams.
You can specify the character encoding when reading data (e.g., UTF-8).
More flexible than FileReader, as it can be used with any InputStream.

Comparison: FileReader vs InputStreamReader
Feature
FileReader
InputStreamReader
Purpose
Reads characters from files
Converts byte stream to character stream
Input Type
Directly reads from files
Works with any InputStream (e.g., files, sockets)
Encoding
Uses system default encoding
Can specify custom encoding (e.g., UTF-8)
Flexibility
Limited to file-based character streams
More flexible, works with byte streams
Usage
Best for text files in the default encoding
Best when you need control over encoding or work with various input sources


Which One to Use?
Use FileReader when reading from text files and the system's default encoding is sufficient.
Use InputStreamReader when:
You need to read from byte streams (e.g., FileInputStream, network streams).
You need to specify a custom encoding (e.g., UTF-8 or UTF-16).

BufferedReader in Java
BufferedReader is a Java class in the java.io package that reads text from an input stream efficiently. It buffers the input to improve performance, making it faster than reading characters one by one.

Key Features:
Reads text efficiently from an input stream.
Supports reading a single character, an array of characters, or an entire line.
Commonly used with FileReader or InputStreamReader.

Example 1: Reading a File using BufferedReader
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;

public class BufferedReaderExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String filePath = "sample.txt"; // Ensure the file exists in the project directory

        try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(filePath))) {
            String line;
            while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) { // Read line by line
                System.out.println(line);
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}


Explanation:
Uses FileReader to read from a file.
BufferedReader reads the file line by line using readLine().
The try-with-resources statement automatically closes the reader after execution.

            System.out.print("Enter your name: ");
            String name = br.readLine();  // Reads input from the user
            System.out.println("Hello, " + name + "!");
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }

        try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(filePath))) {
            String line;
            while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) { // Read line by line
                System.out.println(line);
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}


Explanation:
Uses FileReader to read from a file.
BufferedReader reads the file line by line using readLine().
The try-with-resources statement automatically closes the reader after execution.

Example 2: Reading User Input from Console
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;

public class ConsoleInputExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in))) {
            System.out.print("Enter your name: ");
            String name = br.readLine();  // Reads input from the user
            System.out.println("Hello, " + name + "!");
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}

Explanation:
Uses InputStreamReader(System.in) with BufferedReader to read user input from the console.
readLine() captures the entire input line as a String.

Advantages of BufferedReader
✔ Efficient: Reads larger chunks of data at once, reducing I/O overhead.
✔ Flexible: Can read from files, console, or any input stream.
✔ Thread-safe: Can be synchronized if needed.


FileReader and InputStreamReader
Both FileReader and InputStreamReader are classes in the java.io package that are used to read data from files or other input streams. However, there are differences in their usage and underlying mechanisms.
FileReader
Purpose: Specifically used to read characters from files.
Internals: It is a character stream that makes reading character files easier.
Encoding: It assumes the default character encoding of the system, which can cause issues if you need to handle non-default encodings.
Constructor:
FileReader(String fileName) throws FileNotFoundException
FileReader(File file) throws FileNotFoundException

Example:
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;

public class FileReaderExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (FileReader fr = new FileReader("example.txt")) {
            int i;
            while ((i = fr.read()) != -1) {
                System.out.print((char) i);  // Reads and prints the file's characters
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}


Key Points of FileReader:
Efficient for reading text files.
Character stream: Reads data as characters, so it’s ideal for text-based files (e.g., .txt, .xml).
Not flexible for binary streams (like images, audio files).

InputStreamReader
Purpose: Converts byte streams into character streams, making it useful when dealing with input streams (like reading from a file or network socket) that provide byte data.
Internals: It is a bridge between byte streams and character streams, and it can be used with any InputStream (e.g., FileInputStream, BufferedInputStream).
Encoding: Allows specifying the character encoding (e.g., UTF-8, ISO-8859-1), which makes it more flexible than FileReader.
Constructor:
InputStreamReader(InputStream in) throws UnsupportedEncodingException
InputStreamReader(InputStream in, String encoding) throws UnsupportedEncodingException

Example:
import java.io.FileInputStream;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;
import java.io.IOException;

public class InputStreamReaderExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (InputStreamReader isr = new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream("example.txt"), "UTF-8")) {
            int i;
            while ((i = isr.read()) != -1) {
                System.out.print((char) i);  // Reads the characters from the file with specified encoding
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}

Key Points of InputStreamReader:
Converts byte streams to character streams.
You can specify the character encoding when reading data (e.g., UTF-8).
More flexible than FileReader, as it can be used with any InputStream.

Comparison: FileReader vs InputStreamReader
Feature
FileReader
InputStreamReader
Purpose
Reads characters from files
Converts byte stream to character stream
Input Type

Which One to Use?
Use FileReader when reading from text files and the system's default encoding is sufficient.
Use InputStreamReader when:
You need to read from byte streams (e.g., FileInputStream, network streams).
You need to specify a custom encoding (e.g., UTF-8 or UTF-16).

BufferedReader in Java
BufferedReader is a Java class in the java.io package that reads text from an input stream efficiently. It buffers the input to improve performance, making it faster than reading characters one by one.

Key Features:
Reads text efficiently from an input stream.

BufferedReader in Java
BufferedReader is a Java class in the java.io package that reads text from an input stream efficiently. It buffers the input to improve performance, making it faster than reading characters one by one.

Key Features:
Reads text efficiently from an input stream.
Supports reading a single character, an array of characters, or an entire line.
Commonly used with FileReader or InputStreamReader.

Example 1: Reading a File using BufferedReader
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;

public class BufferedReaderExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String filePath = "sample.txt"; // Ensure the file exists in the project directory

        try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(filePath))) {
            String line;
            while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) { // Read line by line
                System.out.println(line);
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}


Explanation:
Uses FileReader to read from a file.
BufferedReader reads the file line by line using readLine().
The try-with-resources statement automatically closes the reader after execution.

Example 2: Reading User Input from Console
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;

public class ConsoleInputExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in))) {
            System.out.print("Enter your name: ");
            String name = br.readLine();  // Reads input from the user
            System.out.println("Hello, " + name + "!");
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}

Explanation:
Uses InputStreamReader(System.in) with BufferedReader to read user input from the console.
readLine() captures the entire input line as a String.

Advantages of BufferedReader
✔ Efficient: Reads larger chunks of data at once, reducing I/O overhead.
✔ Flexible: Can read from files, console, or any input stream.
✔ Thread-safe: Can be synchronized if needed.


FileReader and InputStreamReader
Both FileReader and InputStreamReader are classes in the java.io package that are used to read data from files or other input streams. However, there are differences in their usage and underlying mechanisms.
FileReader
Purpose: Specifically used to read characters from files.
Internals: It is a character stream that makes reading character files easier.
Encoding: It assumes the default character encoding of the system, which can cause issues if you need to handle non-default encodings.
Constructor:
FileReader(String fileName) throws FileNotFoundException
FileReader(File file) throws FileNotFoundException

Example:
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;

public class FileReaderExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (FileReader fr = new FileReader("example.txt")) {
            int i;
            while ((i = fr.read()) != -1) {
                System.out.print((char) i);  // Reads and prints the file's characters
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}


Key Points of FileReader:
Efficient for reading text files.
Character stream: Reads data as characters, so it’s ideal for text-based files (e.g., .txt, .xml).
Not flexible for binary streams (like images, audio files).

InputStreamReader
Purpose: Converts byte streams into character streams, making it useful when dealing with input streams (like reading from a file or network socket) that provide byte data.
Internals: It is a bridge between byte streams and character streams, and it can be used with any InputStream (e.g., FileInputStream, BufferedInputStream).
Encoding: Allows specifying the character encoding (e.g., UTF-8, ISO-8859-1), which makes it more flexible than FileReader.
Constructor:
InputStreamReader(InputStream in) throws UnsupportedEncodingException
InputStreamReader(InputStream in, String encoding) throws UnsupportedEncodingException

Example:
import java.io.FileInputStream;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;
import java.io.IOException;

public class InputStreamReaderExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (InputStreamReader isr = new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream("example.txt"), "UTF-8")) {
            int i;
            while ((i = isr.read()) != -1) {
                System.out.print((char) i);  // Reads the characters from the file with specified encoding
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }

Key Points of FileReader:
Efficient for reading text files.
Character stream: Reads data as characters, so it’s ideal for text-based files (e.g., .txt, .xml).
Not flexible for binary streams (like images, audio files).

InputStreamReader
Purpose: Converts byte streams into character streams, making it useful when dealing with input streams (like reading from a file or network socket) that provide byte data.
Internals: It is a bridge between byte streams and character streams, and it can be used with any InputStream (e.g., FileInputStream, BufferedInputStream).
Encoding: Allows specifying the character encoding (e.g., UTF-8, ISO-8859-1), which makes it more flexible than FileReader.
Constructor:
InputStreamReader(InputStream in) throws UnsupportedEncodingException
InputStreamReader(InputStream in, String encoding) throws UnsupportedEncodingException

Example:
import java.io.FileInputStream;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;
import java.io.IOException;

public class InputStreamReaderExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (InputStreamReader isr = new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream("example.txt"), "UTF-8")) {
            int i;
            while ((i = isr.read()) != -1) {
                System.out.print((char) i);  // Reads the characters from the file with specified encoding
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}

Key Points of InputStreamReader:
Converts byte streams to character streams.
You can specify the character encoding when reading data (e.g., UTF-8).
More flexible than FileReader, as it can be used with any InputStream.

Comparison: FileReader vs InputStreamReader
Feature
FileReader
InputStreamReader
Purpose
Reads characters from files
Converts byte stream to character stream
Input Type

Which One to Use?
Use FileReader when reading from text files and the system's default encoding is sufficient.
Use InputStreamReader when:
You need to read from byte streams (e.g., FileInputStream, network streams).
You need to specify a custom encoding (e.g., UTF-8 or UTF-16).

BufferedReader in Java
BufferedReader is a Java class in the java.io package that reads text from an input stream efficiently. It buffers the input to improve performance, making it faster than reading characters one by one.

Key Features:
Reads text efficiently from an input stream.
Supports reading a single character, an array of characters, or an entire line.
Commonly used with FileReader or InputStreamReader.

Example 1: Reading a File using BufferedReader
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;

public class BufferedReaderExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String filePath = "sample.txt"; // Ensure the file exists in the project directory

        try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(filePath))) {
            String line;
            while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) { // Read line by line
                System.out.println(line);
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}


Explanation:
Uses FileReader to read from a file.
BufferedReader reads the file line by line using readLine().
The try-with-resources statement automatically closes the reader after execution.

Example 2: Reading User Input from Console
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;

public class ConsoleInputExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in))) {
            System.out.print("Enter your name: ");
            String name = br.readLine();  // Reads input from the user
            System.out.println("Hello, " + name + "!");
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}

Explanation:
Uses InputStreamReader(System.in) with BufferedReader to read user input from the console.
readLine() captures the entire input line as a String.

Advantages of BufferedReader
✔ Efficient: Reads larger chunks of data at once, reducing I/O overhead.
✔ Flexible: Can read from files, console, or any input stream.
✔ Thread-safe: Can be synchronized if needed.


FileReader and InputStreamReader
Both FileReader and InputStreamReader are classes in the java.io package that are used to read data from files or other input streams. However, there are differences in their usage and underlying mechanisms.

            System.out.print("Enter your name: ");
            String name = br.readLine();  // Reads input from the user
            System.out.println("Hello, " + name + "!");
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}

Explanation:
Uses InputStreamReader(System.in) with BufferedReader to read user input from the console.
readLine() captures the entire input line as a String.

Advantages of BufferedReader
✔ Efficient: Reads larger chunks of data at once, reducing I/O overhead.
✔ Flexible: Can read from files, console, or any input stream.
✔ Thread-safe: Can be synchronized if needed.


FileReader and InputStreamReader
Both FileReader and InputStreamReader are classes in the java.io package that are used to read data from files or other input streams. However, there are differences in their usage and underlying mechanisms.
FileReader
Purpose: Specifically used to read characters from files.
Internals: It is a character stream that makes reading character files easier.
Encoding: It assumes the default character encoding of the system, which can cause issues if you need to handle non-default encodings.
Constructor:
FileReader(String fileName) throws FileNotFoundException
FileReader(File file) throws FileNotFoundException

Example:
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;

public class FileReaderExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (FileReader fr = new FileReader("example.txt")) {
            int i;
            while ((i = fr.read()) != -1) {
                System.out.print((char) i);  // Reads and prints the file's characters
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}


Key Points of FileReader:
Efficient for reading text files.
Character stream: Reads data as characters, so it’s ideal for text-based files (e.g., .txt, .xml).
Not flexible for binary streams (like images, audio files).

InputStreamReader
Purpose: Converts byte streams into character streams, making it useful when dealing with input streams (like reading from a file or network socket) that provide byte data.
Internals: It is a bridge between byte streams and character streams, and it can be used with any InputStream (e.g., FileInputStream, BufferedInputStream).
Encoding: Allows specifying the character encoding (e.g., UTF-8, ISO-8859-1), which makes it more flexible than FileReader.
Constructor:
InputStreamReader(InputStream in) throws UnsupportedEncodingException
InputStreamReader(InputStream in, String encoding) throws UnsupportedEncodingException

Example:
import java.io.FileInputStream;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;
import java.io.IOException;

public class InputStreamReaderExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (InputStreamReader isr = new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream("example.txt"), "UTF-8")) {
            int i;
            while ((i = isr.read()) != -1) {
                System.out.print((char) i);  // Reads the characters from the file with specified encoding
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}

Key Points of InputStreamReader:
Converts byte streams to character streams.
You can specify the character encoding when reading data (e.g., UTF-8).
More flexible than FileReader, as it can be used with any InputStream.

Comparison: FileReader vs InputStreamReader
Feature
FileReader
InputStreamReader
Purpose
Reads characters from files
Converts byte stream to character stream
Input Type
Directly reads from files
Works with any InputStream (e.g., files, sockets)
Encoding
Uses system default encoding
Can specify custom encoding (e.g., UTF-8)
Flexibility
Limited to file-based character streams
More flexible, works with byte streams
Usage
Best for text files in the default encoding
Best when you need control over encoding or work with various input sources


Which One to Use?
Use FileReader when reading from text files and the system's default encoding is sufficient.
Use InputStreamReader when:
You need to read from byte streams (e.g., FileInputStream, network streams).
You need to specify a custom encoding (e.g., UTF-8 or UTF-16).

BufferedReader in Java
BufferedReader is a Java class in the java.io package that reads text from an input stream efficiently. It buffers the input to improve performance, making it faster than reading characters one by one.

Key Features:
Reads text efficiently from an input stream.
Supports reading a single character, an array of characters, or an entire line.
Commonly used with FileReader or InputStreamReader.

Example 1: Reading a File using BufferedReader
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;

public class BufferedReaderExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String filePath = "sample.txt"; // Ensure the file exists in the project directory

        try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(filePath))) {
            String line;
            while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) { // Read line by line
                System.out.println(line);
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}


Explanation:
Uses FileReader to read from a file.
BufferedReader reads the file line by line using readLine().
The try-with-resources statement automatically closes the reader after execution.

Example 2: Reading User Input from Console
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;

public class ConsoleInputExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

            System.out.print("Enter your name: ");
            String name = br.readLine();  // Reads input from the user
            System.out.println("Hello, " + name + "!");
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();

You need to specify a custom encoding (e.g., UTF-8 or UTF-16).

BufferedReader in Java
BufferedReader is a Java class in the java.io package that reads text from an input stream efficiently. It buffers the input to improve performance, making it faster than reading characters one by one.

Key Features:
Reads text efficiently from an input stream.
Supports reading a single character, an array of characters, or an entire line.
Commonly used with FileReader or InputStreamReader.

Example 1: Reading a File using BufferedReader
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;

public class BufferedReaderExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String filePath = "sample.txt"; // Ensure the file exists in the project directory

        try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(filePath))) {
            String line;
            while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) { // Read line by line
                System.out.println(line);
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}


Explanation:
Uses FileReader to read from a file.
BufferedReader reads the file line by line using readLine().
The try-with-resources statement automatically closes the reader after execution.

Example 2: Reading User Input from Console
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;

public class ConsoleInputExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in))) {
            System.out.print("Enter your name: ");
            String name = br.readLine();  // Reads input from the user
            System.out.println("Hello, " + name + "!");
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}

Explanation:
Uses InputStreamReader(System.in) with BufferedReader to read user input from the console.
readLine() captures the entire input line as a String.

Advantages of BufferedReader
✔ Efficient: Reads larger chunks of data at once, reducing I/O overhead.
✔ Flexible: Can read from files, console, or any input stream.
✔ Thread-safe: Can be synchronized if needed.


FileReader and InputStreamReader
Both FileReader and InputStreamReader are classes in the java.io package that are used to read data from files or other input streams. However, there are differences in their usage and underlying mechanisms.
FileReader
Purpose: Specifically used to read characters from files.
Internals: It is a character stream that makes reading character files easier.
Encoding: It assumes the default character encoding of the system, which can cause issues if you need to handle non-default encodings.
Constructor:
FileReader(String fileName) throws FileNotFoundException
FileReader(File file) throws FileNotFoundException

Example:
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;

public class FileReaderExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (FileReader fr = new FileReader("example.txt")) {
            int i;
            while ((i = fr.read()) != -1) {
                System.out.print((char) i);  // Reads and prints the file's characters
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}


Key Points of FileReader:
Efficient for reading text files.
Character stream: Reads data as characters, so it’s ideal for text-based files (e.g., .txt, .xml).
Not flexible for binary streams (like images, audio files).

InputStreamReader
Purpose: Converts byte streams into character streams, making it useful when dealing with input streams (like reading from a file or network socket) that provide byte data.
Internals: It is a bridge between byte streams and character streams, and it can be used with any InputStream (e.g., FileInputStream, BufferedInputStream).
Encoding: Allows specifying the character encoding (e.g., UTF-8, ISO-8859-1), which makes it more flexible than FileReader.
Constructor:
InputStreamReader(InputStream in) throws UnsupportedEncodingException
InputStreamReader(InputStream in, String encoding) throws UnsupportedEncodingException

Example:
import java.io.FileInputStream;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;
import java.io.IOException;

public class InputStreamReaderExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (InputStreamReader isr = new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream("example.txt"), "UTF-8")) {
            int i;
            while ((i = isr.read()) != -1) {
                System.out.print((char) i);  // Reads the characters from the file with specified encoding
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}

Key Points of InputStreamReader:
Converts byte streams to character streams.
You can specify the character encoding when reading data (e.g., UTF-8).
More flexible than FileReader, as it can be used with any InputStream.

Comparison: FileReader vs InputStreamReader

You need to specify a custom encoding (e.g., UTF-8 or UTF-16).

BufferedReader in Java
BufferedReader is a Java class in the java.io package that reads text from an input stream efficiently. It buffers the input to improve performance, making it faster than reading characters one by one.

Key Features:
Reads text efficiently from an input stream.
Supports reading a single character, an array of characters, or an entire line.
Commonly used with FileReader or InputStreamReader.

Example 1: Reading a File using BufferedReader
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;

public class BufferedReaderExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String filePath = "sample.txt"; // Ensure the file exists in the project directory

        try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(filePath))) {
            String line;
            while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) { // Read line by line
                System.out.println(line);
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}


Explanation:
Uses FileReader to read from a file.
BufferedReader reads the file line by line using readLine().
The try-with-resources statement automatically closes the reader after execution.

Example 2: Reading User Input from Console
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;

public class ConsoleInputExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in))) {
            System.out.print("Enter your name: ");
            String name = br.readLine();  // Reads input from the user
            System.out.println("Hello, " + name + "!");
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}

Explanation:
Uses InputStreamReader(System.in) with BufferedReader to read user input from the console.
readLine() captures the entire input line as a String.

Advantages of BufferedReader
✔ Efficient: Reads larger chunks of data at once, reducing I/O overhead.
✔ Flexible: Can read from files, console, or any input stream.
✔ Thread-safe: Can be synchronized if needed.


FileReader and InputStreamReader
Both FileReader and InputStreamReader are classes in the java.io package that are used to read data from files or other input streams. However, there are differences in their usage and underlying mechanisms.
FileReader
Purpose: Specifically used to read characters from files.
Internals: It is a character stream that makes reading character files easier.
Encoding: It assumes the default character encoding of the system, which can cause issues if you need to handle non-default encodings.
Constructor:
FileReader(String fileName) throws FileNotFoundException
FileReader(File file) throws FileNotFoundException

Example:
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;

public class FileReaderExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (FileReader fr = new FileReader("example.txt")) {
            int i;
            while ((i = fr.read()) != -1) {
                System.out.print((char) i);  // Reads and prints the file's characters
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}


Key Points of FileReader:
Efficient for reading text files.
Character stream: Reads data as characters, so it’s ideal for text-based files (e.g., .txt, .xml).
Not flexible for binary streams (like images, audio files).

InputStreamReader
Purpose: Converts byte streams into character streams, making it useful when dealing with input streams (like reading from a file or network socket) that provide byte data.
Internals: It is a bridge between byte streams and character streams, and it can be used with any InputStream (e.g., FileInputStream, BufferedInputStream).
Encoding: Allows specifying the character encoding (e.g., UTF-8, ISO-8859-1), which makes it more flexible than FileReader.
Constructor:
InputStreamReader(InputStream in) throws UnsupportedEncodingException
InputStreamReader(InputStream in, String encoding) throws UnsupportedEncodingException

Example:
import java.io.FileInputStream;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;
import java.io.IOException;

public class InputStreamReaderExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (InputStreamReader isr = new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream("example.txt"), "UTF-8")) {
            int i;
            while ((i = isr.read()) != -1) {
                System.out.print((char) i);  // Reads the characters from the file with specified encoding
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {

Key Points of FileReader:
Efficient for reading text files.
Character stream: Reads data as characters, so it’s ideal for text-based files (e.g., .txt, .xml).
Not flexible for binary streams (like images, audio files).

InputStreamReader
Purpose: Converts byte streams into character streams, making it useful when dealing with input streams (like reading from a file or network socket) that provide byte data.
Internals: It is a bridge between byte streams and character streams, and it can be used with any InputStream (e.g., FileInputStream, BufferedInputStream).
Encoding: Allows specifying the character encoding (e.g., UTF-8, ISO-8859-1), which makes it more flexible than FileReader.
Constructor:
InputStreamReader(InputStream in) throws UnsupportedEncodingException
InputStreamReader(InputStream in, String encoding) throws UnsupportedEncodingException

Example:
import java.io.FileInputStream;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;
import java.io.IOException;

public class InputStreamReaderExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (InputStreamReader isr = new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream("example.txt"), "UTF-8")) {
            int i;
            while ((i = isr.read()) != -1) {
                System.out.print((char) i);  // Reads the characters from the file with specified encoding
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}

Key Points of InputStreamReader:
Converts byte streams to character streams.
You can specify the character encoding when reading data (e.g., UTF-8).
More flexible than FileReader, as it can be used with any InputStream.

Comparison: FileReader vs InputStreamReader
Feature
FileReader
InputStreamReader
Purpose
Reads characters from files
Converts byte stream to character stream
Input Type

Which One to Use?
Use FileReader when reading from text files and the system's default encoding is sufficient.
Use InputStreamReader when:
You need to read from byte streams (e.g., FileInputStream, network streams).
You need to specify a custom encoding (e.g., UTF-8 or UTF-16).

BufferedReader in Java
BufferedReader is a Java class in the java.io package that reads text from an input stream efficiently. It buffers the input to improve performance, making it faster than reading characters one by one.

Key Features:
Reads text efficiently from an input stream.
Supports reading a single character, an array of characters, or an entire line.
Commonly used with FileReader or InputStreamReader.

Example 1: Reading a File using BufferedReader
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;

public class BufferedReaderExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String filePath = "sample.txt"; // Ensure the file exists in the project directory

        try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(filePath))) {
            String line;
            while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) { // Read line by line
                System.out.println(line);
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}


Explanation:
Uses FileReader to read from a file.
BufferedReader reads the file line by line using readLine().
The try-with-resources statement automatically closes the reader after execution.

Example 2: Reading User Input from Console
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;

public class ConsoleInputExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in))) {
            System.out.print("Enter your name: ");
            String name = br.readLine();  // Reads input from the user
            System.out.println("Hello, " + name + "!");
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}

Explanation:
Uses InputStreamReader(System.in) with BufferedReader to read user input from the console.
readLine() captures the entire input line as a String.

Advantages of BufferedReader
✔ Efficient: Reads larger chunks of data at once, reducing I/O overhead.
✔ Flexible: Can read from files, console, or any input stream.
✔ Thread-safe: Can be synchronized if needed.

Uses FileReader to read from a file.
BufferedReader reads the file line by line using readLine().
The try-with-resources statement automatically closes the reader after execution.

Example 2: Reading User Input from Console
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;

public class ConsoleInputExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in))) {
            System.out.print("Enter your name: ");
            String name = br.readLine();  // Reads input from the user
            System.out.println("Hello, " + name + "!");
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}

Explanation:
Uses InputStreamReader(System.in) with BufferedReader to read user input from the console.
readLine() captures the entire input line as a String.

Advantages of BufferedReader
✔ Efficient: Reads larger chunks of data at once, reducing I/O overhead.
✔ Flexible: Can read from files, console, or any input stream.
✔ Thread-safe: Can be synchronized if needed.


FileReader and InputStreamReader
Both FileReader and InputStreamReader are classes in the java.io package that are used to read data from files or other input streams. However, there are differences in their usage and underlying mechanisms.
FileReader
Purpose: Specifically used to read characters from files.
Internals: It is a character stream that makes reading character files easier.
Encoding: It assumes the default character encoding of the system, which can cause issues if you need to handle non-default encodings.
Constructor:
FileReader(String fileName) throws FileNotFoundException
FileReader(File file) throws FileNotFoundException

Example:
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;

public class FileReaderExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (FileReader fr = new FileReader("example.txt")) {
            int i;
            while ((i = fr.read()) != -1) {
                System.out.print((char) i);  // Reads and prints the file's characters
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}


Key Points of FileReader:
Efficient for reading text files.
Character stream: Reads data as characters, so it’s ideal for text-based files (e.g., .txt, .xml).
Not flexible for binary streams (like images, audio files).

InputStreamReader
Purpose: Converts byte streams into character streams, making it useful when dealing with input streams (like reading from a file or network socket) that provide byte data.
Internals: It is a bridge between byte streams and character streams, and it can be used with any InputStream (e.g., FileInputStream, BufferedInputStream).
Encoding: Allows specifying the character encoding (e.g., UTF-8, ISO-8859-1), which makes it more flexible than FileReader.
Constructor:
InputStreamReader(InputStream in) throws UnsupportedEncodingException
InputStreamReader(InputStream in, String encoding) throws UnsupportedEncodingException

Example:
import java.io.FileInputStream;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;
import java.io.IOException;

public class InputStreamReaderExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (InputStreamReader isr = new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream("example.txt"), "UTF-8")) {
            int i;
            while ((i = isr.read()) != -1) {
                System.out.print((char) i);  // Reads the characters from the file with specified encoding
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}

Key Points of InputStreamReader:
Converts byte streams to character streams.
You can specify the character encoding when reading data (e.g., UTF-8).
More flexible than FileReader, as it can be used with any InputStream.

Comparison: FileReader vs InputStreamReader
Feature
FileReader
InputStreamReader
Purpose
Reads characters from files

Which One to Use?
Use FileReader when reading from text files and the system's default encoding is sufficient.
Use InputStreamReader when:
You need to read from byte streams (e.g., FileInputStream, network streams).
You need to specify a custom encoding (e.g., UTF-8 or UTF-16).

BufferedReader in Java
BufferedReader is a Java class in the java.io package that reads text from an input stream efficiently. It buffers the input to improve performance, making it faster than reading characters one by one.

Key Features:
Reads text efficiently from an input stream.
Supports reading a single character, an array of characters, or an entire line.
Commonly used with FileReader or InputStreamReader.

        try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(filePath))) {
            String line;
            while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) { // Read line by line
                System.out.println(line);
            }

Best for text files in the default encoding
Best when you need control over encoding or work with various input sources


Which One to Use?
Use FileReader when reading from text files and the system's default encoding is sufficient.
Use InputStreamReader when:
You need to read from byte streams (e.g., FileInputStream, network streams).
You need to specify a custom encoding (e.g., UTF-8 or UTF-16).

BufferedReader in Java
BufferedReader is a Java class in the java.io package that reads text from an input stream efficiently. It buffers the input to improve performance, making it faster than reading characters one by one.

Key Features:
Reads text efficiently from an input stream.
Supports reading a single character, an array of characters, or an entire line.
Commonly used with FileReader or InputStreamReader.

Example 1: Reading a File using BufferedReader
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;

public class BufferedReaderExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String filePath = "sample.txt"; // Ensure the file exists in the project directory

        try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(filePath))) {
            String line;
            while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) { // Read line by line
                System.out.println(line);
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}


Explanation:
Uses FileReader to read from a file.
BufferedReader reads the file line by line using readLine().
The try-with-resources statement automatically closes the reader after execution.

Example 2: Reading User Input from Console
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;

public class ConsoleInputExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in))) {
            System.out.print("Enter your name: ");
            String name = br.readLine();  // Reads input from the user
            System.out.println("Hello, " + name + "!");
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}

Explanation:
Uses InputStreamReader(System.in) with BufferedReader to read user input from the console.
readLine() captures the entire input line as a String.

Advantages of BufferedReader
✔ Efficient: Reads larger chunks of data at once, reducing I/O overhead.
✔ Flexible: Can read from files, console, or any input stream.
✔ Thread-safe: Can be synchronized if needed.


FileReader and InputStreamReader
Both FileReader and InputStreamReader are classes in the java.io package that are used to read data from files or other input streams. However, there are differences in their usage and underlying mechanisms.
FileReader
Purpose: Specifically used to read characters from files.
Internals: It is a character stream that makes reading character files easier.
Encoding: It assumes the default character encoding of the system, which can cause issues if you need to handle non-default encodings.
Constructor:
FileReader(String fileName) throws FileNotFoundException
FileReader(File file) throws FileNotFoundException

Example:
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;

public class FileReaderExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (FileReader fr = new FileReader("example.txt")) {
            int i;
            while ((i = fr.read()) != -1) {
                System.out.print((char) i);  // Reads and prints the file's characters
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}


Key Points of FileReader:
Efficient for reading text files.
Character stream: Reads data as characters, so it’s ideal for text-based files (e.g., .txt, .xml).
Not flexible for binary streams (like images, audio files).

InputStreamReader
Purpose: Converts byte streams into character streams, making it useful when dealing with input streams (like reading from a file or network socket) that provide byte data.
Internals: It is a bridge between byte streams and character streams, and it can be used with any InputStream (e.g., FileInputStream, BufferedInputStream).
Encoding: Allows specifying the character encoding (e.g., UTF-8, ISO-8859-1), which makes it more flexible than FileReader.
Constructor:
InputStreamReader(InputStream in) throws UnsupportedEncodingException
InputStreamReader(InputStream in, String encoding) throws UnsupportedEncodingException

Example:
import java.io.FileInputStream;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;
import java.io.IOException;

public class InputStreamReaderExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (InputStreamReader isr = new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream("example.txt"), "UTF-8")) {
            int i;
            while ((i = isr.read()) != -1) {
                System.out.print((char) i);  // Reads the characters from the file with specified encoding
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}

Key Points of InputStreamReader:
Converts byte streams to character streams.
You can specify the character encoding when reading data (e.g., UTF-8).
More flexible than FileReader, as it can be used with any InputStream.

Encoding: Allows specifying the character encoding (e.g., UTF-8, ISO-8859-1), which makes it more flexible than FileReader.
Constructor:
InputStreamReader(InputStream in) throws UnsupportedEncodingException
InputStreamReader(InputStream in, String encoding) throws UnsupportedEncodingException

Example:
import java.io.FileInputStream;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;
import java.io.IOException;

public class InputStreamReaderExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (InputStreamReader isr = new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream("example.txt"), "UTF-8")) {
            int i;
            while ((i = isr.read()) != -1) {
                System.out.print((char) i);  // Reads the characters from the file with specified encoding
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}

Key Points of InputStreamReader:
Converts byte streams to character streams.
You can specify the character encoding when reading data (e.g., UTF-8).

You need to specify a custom encoding (e.g., UTF-8 or UTF-16).

BufferedReader in Java
BufferedReader is a Java class in the java.io package that reads text from an input stream efficiently. It buffers the input to improve performance, making it faster than reading characters one by one.

Key Features:
Reads text efficiently from an input stream.
Supports reading a single character, an array of characters, or an entire line.
Commonly used with FileReader or InputStreamReader.

Example 1: Reading a File using BufferedReader
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;

public class BufferedReaderExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String filePath = "sample.txt"; // Ensure the file exists in the project directory

        try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(filePath))) {
            String line;
            while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) { // Read line by line
                System.out.println(line);
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}


Explanation:
Uses FileReader to read from a file.
BufferedReader reads the file line by line using readLine().
The try-with-resources statement automatically closes the reader after execution.

Example 2: Reading User Input from Console
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;

public class ConsoleInputExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in))) {
            System.out.print("Enter your name: ");
            String name = br.readLine();  // Reads input from the user
            System.out.println("Hello, " + name + "!");
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}

Explanation:
Uses InputStreamReader(System.in) with BufferedReader to read user input from the console.
readLine() captures the entire input line as a String.

Advantages of BufferedReader
✔ Efficient: Reads larger chunks of data at once, reducing I/O overhead.
✔ Flexible: Can read from files, console, or any input stream.
✔ Thread-safe: Can be synchronized if needed.


FileReader and InputStreamReader
Both FileReader and InputStreamReader are classes in the java.io package that are used to read data from files or other input streams. However, there are differences in their usage and underlying mechanisms.
FileReader
Purpose: Specifically used to read characters from files.
Internals: It is a character stream that makes reading character files easier.
Encoding: It assumes the default character encoding of the system, which can cause issues if you need to handle non-default encodings.
Constructor:
FileReader(String fileName) throws FileNotFoundException
FileReader(File file) throws FileNotFoundException

Example:
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;

public class FileReaderExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (FileReader fr = new FileReader("example.txt")) {
            int i;
            while ((i = fr.read()) != -1) {
                System.out.print((char) i);  // Reads and prints the file's characters
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}

✔ Flexible: Can read from files, console, or any input stream.
✔ Thread-safe: Can be synchronized if needed.


FileReader and InputStreamReader
Both FileReader and InputStreamReader are classes in the java.io package that are used to read data from files or other input streams. However, there are differences in their usage and underlying mechanisms.
FileReader
Purpose: Specifically used to read characters from files.
Internals: It is a character stream that makes reading character files easier.
Encoding: It assumes the default character encoding of the system, which can cause issues if you need to handle non-default encodings.
Constructor:
FileReader(String fileName) throws FileNotFoundException
FileReader(File file) throws FileNotFoundException

Example:
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;

public class FileReaderExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (FileReader fr = new FileReader("example.txt")) {
            int i;
            while ((i = fr.read()) != -1) {
                System.out.print((char) i);  // Reads and prints the file's characters
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}


Key Points of FileReader:
Efficient for reading text files.
Character stream: Reads data as characters, so it’s ideal for text-based files (e.g., .txt, .xml).
Not flexible for binary streams (like images, audio files).

InputStreamReader
Purpose: Converts byte streams into character streams, making it useful when dealing with input streams (like reading from a file or network socket) that provide byte data.
Internals: It is a bridge between byte streams and character streams, and it can be used with any InputStream (e.g., FileInputStream, BufferedInputStream).
Encoding: Allows specifying the character encoding (e.g., UTF-8, ISO-8859-1), which makes it more flexible than FileReader.
Constructor:
InputStreamReader(InputStream in) throws UnsupportedEncodingException
InputStreamReader(InputStream in, String encoding) throws UnsupportedEncodingException

Example:
import java.io.FileInputStream;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;
import java.io.IOException;

public class InputStreamReaderExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (InputStreamReader isr = new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream("example.txt"), "UTF-8")) {
            int i;
            while ((i = isr.read()) != -1) {
                System.out.print((char) i);  // Reads the characters from the file with specified encoding
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}

Key Points of InputStreamReader:
Converts byte streams to character streams.
You can specify the character encoding when reading data (e.g., UTF-8).
More flexible than FileReader, as it can be used with any InputStream.

Comparison: FileReader vs InputStreamReader
Feature
FileReader
InputStreamReader
Purpose
Reads characters from files
Converts byte stream to character stream
Input Type
Directly reads from files
Works with any InputStream (e.g., files, sockets)
Encoding
Uses system default encoding
Can specify custom encoding (e.g., UTF-8)
Flexibility
Limited to file-based character streams
More flexible, works with byte streams
Usage
Best for text files in the default encoding
Best when you need control over encoding or work with various input sources


Which One to Use?
Use FileReader when reading from text files and the system's default encoding is sufficient.
Use InputStreamReader when:
You need to read from byte streams (e.g., FileInputStream, network streams).
You need to specify a custom encoding (e.g., UTF-8 or UTF-16).

BufferedReader in Java
BufferedReader is a Java class in the java.io package that reads text from an input stream efficiently. It buffers the input to improve performance, making it faster than reading characters one by one.

Key Features:
Reads text efficiently from an input stream.
Supports reading a single character, an array of characters, or an entire line.
Commonly used with FileReader or InputStreamReader.

Example 1: Reading a File using BufferedReader
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;

public class BufferedReaderExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String filePath = "sample.txt"; // Ensure the file exists in the project directory

        try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(filePath))) {
            String line;
            while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) { // Read line by line
                System.out.println(line);
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}


Explanation:
Uses FileReader to read from a file.
BufferedReader reads the file line by line using readLine().
The try-with-resources statement automatically closes the reader after execution.

Example 2: Reading User Input from Console
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;

public class ConsoleInputExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in))) {
            System.out.print("Enter your name: ");
            String name = br.readLine();  // Reads input from the user
            System.out.println("Hello, " + name + "!");
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}

Explanation:
Uses InputStreamReader(System.in) with BufferedReader to read user input from the console.
readLine() captures the entire input line as a String.

            String line;
            while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) { // Read line by line
                System.out.println(line);
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}


Explanation:
Uses FileReader to read from a file.
BufferedReader reads the file line by line using readLine().
The try-with-resources statement automatically closes the reader after execution.

Example 2: Reading User Input from Console
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;

public class ConsoleInputExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in))) {
            System.out.print("Enter your name: ");
            String name = br.readLine();  // Reads input from the user
            System.out.println("Hello, " + name + "!");
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}

Explanation:
Uses InputStreamReader(System.in) with BufferedReader to read user input from the console.
readLine() captures the entire input line as a String.

Advantages of BufferedReader
✔ Efficient: Reads larger chunks of data at once, reducing I/O overhead.
✔ Flexible: Can read from files, console, or any input stream.
✔ Thread-safe: Can be synchronized if needed.


FileReader and InputStreamReader
Both FileReader and InputStreamReader are classes in the java.io package that are used to read data from files or other input streams. However, there are differences in their usage and underlying mechanisms.
FileReader
Purpose: Specifically used to read characters from files.
Internals: It is a character stream that makes reading character files easier.
Encoding: It assumes the default character encoding of the system, which can cause issues if you need to handle non-default encodings.
Constructor:
FileReader(String fileName) throws FileNotFoundException
FileReader(File file) throws FileNotFoundException

Example:
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;

public class FileReaderExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (FileReader fr = new FileReader("example.txt")) {
            int i;
            while ((i = fr.read()) != -1) {
                System.out.print((char) i);  // Reads and prints the file's characters
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}


Key Points of FileReader:
Efficient for reading text files.
Character stream: Reads data as characters, so it’s ideal for text-based files (e.g., .txt, .xml).
Not flexible for binary streams (like images, audio files).

InputStreamReader
Purpose: Converts byte streams into character streams, making it useful when dealing with input streams (like reading from a file or network socket) that provide byte data.
Internals: It is a bridge between byte streams and character streams, and it can be used with any InputStream (e.g., FileInputStream, BufferedInputStream).
Encoding: Allows specifying the character encoding (e.g., UTF-8, ISO-8859-1), which makes it more flexible than FileReader.
Constructor:
InputStreamReader(InputStream in) throws UnsupportedEncodingException
InputStreamReader(InputStream in, String encoding) throws UnsupportedEncodingException

Example:
import java.io.FileInputStream;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;
import java.io.IOException;

public class InputStreamReaderExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (InputStreamReader isr = new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream("example.txt"), "UTF-8")) {
            int i;
            while ((i = isr.read()) != -1) {
                System.out.print((char) i);  // Reads the characters from the file with specified encoding
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}

Key Points of InputStreamReader:
Converts byte streams to character streams.
You can specify the character encoding when reading data (e.g., UTF-8).
More flexible than FileReader, as it can be used with any InputStream.

Comparison: FileReader vs InputStreamReader
Feature
FileReader
InputStreamReader
Purpose
Reads characters from files
Converts byte stream to character stream
Input Type

Usage
Best for text files in the default encoding
Best when you need control over encoding or work with various input sources


Which One to Use?
Use FileReader when reading from text files and the system's default encoding is sufficient.
Use InputStreamReader when:
You need to read from byte streams (e.g., FileInputStream, network streams).
You need to specify a custom encoding (e.g., UTF-8 or UTF-16).

BufferedReader in Java
BufferedReader is a Java class in the java.io package that reads text from an input stream efficiently. It buffers the input to improve performance, making it faster than reading characters one by one.

Key Features:
Reads text efficiently from an input stream.

BufferedReader in Java
BufferedReader is a Java class in the java.io package that reads text from an input stream efficiently. It buffers the input to improve performance, making it faster than reading characters one by one.

Key Features:
Reads text efficiently from an input stream.
Supports reading a single character, an array of characters, or an entire line.
Commonly used with FileReader or InputStreamReader.

Example 1: Reading a File using BufferedReader
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;

public class BufferedReaderExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String filePath = "sample.txt"; // Ensure the file exists in the project directory

        try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(filePath))) {
            String line;
            while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) { // Read line by line
                System.out.println(line);
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}


Explanation:
Uses FileReader to read from a file.
BufferedReader reads the file line by line using readLine().
The try-with-resources statement automatically closes the reader after execution.

Example 2: Reading User Input from Console
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;

public class ConsoleInputExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in))) {
            System.out.print("Enter your name: ");
            String name = br.readLine();  // Reads input from the user
            System.out.println("Hello, " + name + "!");
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}

Explanation:
Uses InputStreamReader(System.in) with BufferedReader to read user input from the console.
readLine() captures the entire input line as a String.

Advantages of BufferedReader
✔ Efficient: Reads larger chunks of data at once, reducing I/O overhead.
✔ Flexible: Can read from files, console, or any input stream.
✔ Thread-safe: Can be synchronized if needed.


FileReader and InputStreamReader
Both FileReader and InputStreamReader are classes in the java.io package that are used to read data from files or other input streams. However, there are differences in their usage and underlying mechanisms.
FileReader
Purpose: Specifically used to read characters from files.
Internals: It is a character stream that makes reading character files easier.
Encoding: It assumes the default character encoding of the system, which can cause issues if you need to handle non-default encodings.
Constructor:
FileReader(String fileName) throws FileNotFoundException
FileReader(File file) throws FileNotFoundException

Example:
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;

public class FileReaderExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (FileReader fr = new FileReader("example.txt")) {
            int i;
            while ((i = fr.read()) != -1) {
                System.out.print((char) i);  // Reads and prints the file's characters
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}


Key Points of FileReader:
Efficient for reading text files.
Character stream: Reads data as characters, so it’s ideal for text-based files (e.g., .txt, .xml).
Not flexible for binary streams (like images, audio files).

InputStreamReader
Purpose: Converts byte streams into character streams, making it useful when dealing with input streams (like reading from a file or network socket) that provide byte data.
Internals: It is a bridge between byte streams and character streams, and it can be used with any InputStream (e.g., FileInputStream, BufferedInputStream).
Encoding: Allows specifying the character encoding (e.g., UTF-8, ISO-8859-1), which makes it more flexible than FileReader.
Constructor:
InputStreamReader(InputStream in) throws UnsupportedEncodingException
InputStreamReader(InputStream in, String encoding) throws UnsupportedEncodingException

Example:
import java.io.FileInputStream;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;
import java.io.IOException;

public class InputStreamReaderExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (InputStreamReader isr = new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream("example.txt"), "UTF-8")) {
            int i;
            while ((i = isr.read()) != -1) {
                System.out.print((char) i);  // Reads the characters from the file with specified encoding
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }

Key Points of FileReader:
Efficient for reading text files.
Character stream: Reads data as characters, so it’s ideal for text-based files (e.g., .txt, .xml).
Not flexible for binary streams (like images, audio files).

InputStreamReader
Purpose: Converts byte streams into character streams, making it useful when dealing with input streams (like reading from a file or network socket) that provide byte data.
Internals: It is a bridge between byte streams and character streams, and it can be used with any InputStream (e.g., FileInputStream, BufferedInputStream).
Encoding: Allows specifying the character encoding (e.g., UTF-8, ISO-8859-1), which makes it more flexible than FileReader.
Constructor:
InputStreamReader(InputStream in) throws UnsupportedEncodingException
InputStreamReader(InputStream in, String encoding) throws UnsupportedEncodingException

Example:
import java.io.FileInputStream;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;
import java.io.IOException;

public class InputStreamReaderExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (InputStreamReader isr = new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream("example.txt"), "UTF-8")) {
            int i;
            while ((i = isr.read()) != -1) {
                System.out.print((char) i);  // Reads the characters from the file with specified encoding
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}

Key Points of InputStreamReader:
Converts byte streams to character streams.
You can specify the character encoding when reading data (e.g., UTF-8).
More flexible than FileReader, as it can be used with any InputStream.

Comparison: FileReader vs InputStreamReader
Feature
FileReader
InputStreamReader
Purpose
Reads characters from files
Converts byte stream to character stream
Input Type

Which One to Use?
Use FileReader when reading from text files and the system's default encoding is sufficient.
Use InputStreamReader when:
You need to read from byte streams (e.g., FileInputStream, network streams).
You need to specify a custom encoding (e.g., UTF-8 or UTF-16).

BufferedReader in Java
BufferedReader is a Java class in the java.io package that reads text from an input stream efficiently. It buffers the input to improve performance, making it faster than reading characters one by one.

Key Features:
Reads text efficiently from an input stream.
Supports reading a single character, an array of characters, or an entire line.
Commonly used with FileReader or InputStreamReader.

Example 1: Reading a File using BufferedReader
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;

public class BufferedReaderExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String filePath = "sample.txt"; // Ensure the file exists in the project directory

        try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(filePath))) {
            String line;
            while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) { // Read line by line
                System.out.println(line);
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}


Explanation:
Uses FileReader to read from a file.
BufferedReader reads the file line by line using readLine().
The try-with-resources statement automatically closes the reader after execution.

Example 2: Reading User Input from Console
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;

public class ConsoleInputExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in))) {
            System.out.print("Enter your name: ");
            String name = br.readLine();  // Reads input from the user
            System.out.println("Hello, " + name + "!");
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}

Explanation:
Uses InputStreamReader(System.in) with BufferedReader to read user input from the console.
readLine() captures the entire input line as a String.

Advantages of BufferedReader
✔ Efficient: Reads larger chunks of data at once, reducing I/O overhead.
✔ Flexible: Can read from files, console, or any input stream.
✔ Thread-safe: Can be synchronized if needed.


FileReader and InputStreamReader
Both FileReader and InputStreamReader are classes in the java.io package that are used to read data from files or other input streams. However, there are differences in their usage and underlying mechanisms.

            String name = br.readLine();  // Reads input from the user
            System.out.println("Hello, " + name + "!");
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}

Explanation:
Uses InputStreamReader(System.in) with BufferedReader to read user input from the console.
readLine() captures the entire input line as a String.

Advantages of BufferedReader
✔ Efficient: Reads larger chunks of data at once, reducing I/O overhead.
✔ Flexible: Can read from files, console, or any input stream.
✔ Thread-safe: Can be synchronized if needed.


FileReader and InputStreamReader
Both FileReader and InputStreamReader are classes in the java.io package that are used to read data from files or other input streams. However, there are differences in their usage and underlying mechanisms.
FileReader
Purpose: Specifically used to read characters from files.
Internals: It is a character stream that makes reading character files easier.
Encoding: It assumes the default character encoding of the system, which can cause issues if you need to handle non-default encodings.
Constructor:
FileReader(String fileName) throws FileNotFoundException
FileReader(File file) throws FileNotFoundException

Example:
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;

public class FileReaderExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (FileReader fr = new FileReader("example.txt")) {
            int i;
            while ((i = fr.read()) != -1) {
                System.out.print((char) i);  // Reads and prints the file's characters
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}


Key Points of FileReader:
Efficient for reading text files.
Character stream: Reads data as characters, so it’s ideal for text-based files (e.g., .txt, .xml).
Not flexible for binary streams (like images, audio files).

InputStreamReader
Purpose: Converts byte streams into character streams, making it useful when dealing with input streams (like reading from a file or network socket) that provide byte data.
Internals: It is a bridge between byte streams and character streams, and it can be used with any InputStream (e.g., FileInputStream, BufferedInputStream).
Encoding: Allows specifying the character encoding (e.g., UTF-8, ISO-8859-1), which makes it more flexible than FileReader.
Constructor:
InputStreamReader(InputStream in) throws UnsupportedEncodingException
InputStreamReader(InputStream in, String encoding) throws UnsupportedEncodingException

Example:
import java.io.FileInputStream;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;
import java.io.IOException;

public class InputStreamReaderExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (InputStreamReader isr = new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream("example.txt"), "UTF-8")) {
            int i;
            while ((i = isr.read()) != -1) {
                System.out.print((char) i);  // Reads the characters from the file with specified encoding
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}

Key Points of InputStreamReader:
Converts byte streams to character streams.
You can specify the character encoding when reading data (e.g., UTF-8).
More flexible than FileReader, as it can be used with any InputStream.

Comparison: FileReader vs InputStreamReader
Feature
FileReader
InputStreamReader
Purpose
Reads characters from files
Converts byte stream to character stream
Input Type
Directly reads from files
Works with any InputStream (e.g., files, sockets)
Encoding
Uses system default encoding
Can specify custom encoding (e.g., UTF-8)
Flexibility
Limited to file-based character streams
More flexible, works with byte streams
Usage
Best for text files in the default encoding
Best when you need control over encoding or work with various input sources


Which One to Use?
Use FileReader when reading from text files and the system's default encoding is sufficient.
Use InputStreamReader when:
You need to read from byte streams (e.g., FileInputStream, network streams).
You need to specify a custom encoding (e.g., UTF-8 or UTF-16).

BufferedReader in Java
BufferedReader is a Java class in the java.io package that reads text from an input stream efficiently. It buffers the input to improve performance, making it faster than reading characters one by one.

Key Features:
Reads text efficiently from an input stream.
Supports reading a single character, an array of characters, or an entire line.
Commonly used with FileReader or InputStreamReader.

Example 1: Reading a File using BufferedReader
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;

public class BufferedReaderExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String filePath = "sample.txt"; // Ensure the file exists in the project directory

        try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(filePath))) {
            String line;
            while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) { // Read line by line
                System.out.println(line);
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}


Explanation:
Uses FileReader to read from a file.
BufferedReader reads the file line by line using readLine().
The try-with-resources statement automatically closes the reader after execution.

Example 2: Reading User Input from Console
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;

public class ConsoleInputExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

            System.out.print("Enter your name: ");
            String name = br.readLine();  // Reads input from the user
            System.out.println("Hello, " + name + "!");
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();

BufferedReader is a Java class in the java.io package that reads text from an input stream efficiently. It buffers the input to improve performance, making it faster than reading characters one by one.

Key Features:
Reads text efficiently from an input stream.
Supports reading a single character, an array of characters, or an entire line.
Commonly used with FileReader or InputStreamReader.

Example 1: Reading a File using BufferedReader
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;

public class BufferedReaderExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String filePath = "sample.txt"; // Ensure the file exists in the project directory

        try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(filePath))) {
            String line;
            while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) { // Read line by line
                System.out.println(line);
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}


Explanation:
Uses FileReader to read from a file.
BufferedReader reads the file line by line using readLine().
The try-with-resources statement automatically closes the reader after execution.

Example 2: Reading User Input from Console
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;

public class ConsoleInputExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in))) {
            System.out.print("Enter your name: ");
            String name = br.readLine();  // Reads input from the user
            System.out.println("Hello, " + name + "!");
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}

Explanation:
Uses InputStreamReader(System.in) with BufferedReader to read user input from the console.
readLine() captures the entire input line as a String.

Advantages of BufferedReader
✔ Efficient: Reads larger chunks of data at once, reducing I/O overhead.
✔ Flexible: Can read from files, console, or any input stream.
✔ Thread-safe: Can be synchronized if needed.


FileReader and InputStreamReader
Both FileReader and InputStreamReader are classes in the java.io package that are used to read data from files or other input streams. However, there are differences in their usage and underlying mechanisms.
FileReader
Purpose: Specifically used to read characters from files.
Internals: It is a character stream that makes reading character files easier.
Encoding: It assumes the default character encoding of the system, which can cause issues if you need to handle non-default encodings.
Constructor:
FileReader(String fileName) throws FileNotFoundException
FileReader(File file) throws FileNotFoundException

Example:
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;

public class FileReaderExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (FileReader fr = new FileReader("example.txt")) {
            int i;
            while ((i = fr.read()) != -1) {
                System.out.print((char) i);  // Reads and prints the file's characters
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}


Key Points of FileReader:
Efficient for reading text files.
Character stream: Reads data as characters, so it’s ideal for text-based files (e.g., .txt, .xml).
Not flexible for binary streams (like images, audio files).

InputStreamReader
Purpose: Converts byte streams into character streams, making it useful when dealing with input streams (like reading from a file or network socket) that provide byte data.
Internals: It is a bridge between byte streams and character streams, and it can be used with any InputStream (e.g., FileInputStream, BufferedInputStream).
Encoding: Allows specifying the character encoding (e.g., UTF-8, ISO-8859-1), which makes it more flexible than FileReader.
Constructor:
InputStreamReader(InputStream in) throws UnsupportedEncodingException
InputStreamReader(InputStream in, String encoding) throws UnsupportedEncodingException

Example:
import java.io.FileInputStream;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;
import java.io.IOException;

public class InputStreamReaderExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (InputStreamReader isr = new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream("example.txt"), "UTF-8")) {
            int i;
            while ((i = isr.read()) != -1) {
                System.out.print((char) i);  // Reads the characters from the file with specified encoding
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}

Key Points of InputStreamReader:
Converts byte streams to character streams.
You can specify the character encoding when reading data (e.g., UTF-8).
More flexible than FileReader, as it can be used with any InputStream.

Comparison: FileReader vs InputStreamReader
Feature

BufferedReader in Java
BufferedReader is a Java class in the java.io package that reads text from an input stream efficiently. It buffers the input to improve performance, making it faster than reading characters one by one.

Key Features:
Reads text efficiently from an input stream.
Supports reading a single character, an array of characters, or an entire line.
Commonly used with FileReader or InputStreamReader.

Example 1: Reading a File using BufferedReader
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;

public class BufferedReaderExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String filePath = "sample.txt"; // Ensure the file exists in the project directory

        try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(filePath))) {
            String line;
            while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) { // Read line by line
                System.out.println(line);
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}


Explanation:
Uses FileReader to read from a file.
BufferedReader reads the file line by line using readLine().
The try-with-resources statement automatically closes the reader after execution.

Example 2: Reading User Input from Console
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;

public class ConsoleInputExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in))) {
            System.out.print("Enter your name: ");
            String name = br.readLine();  // Reads input from the user
            System.out.println("Hello, " + name + "!");
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}

Explanation:
Uses InputStreamReader(System.in) with BufferedReader to read user input from the console.
readLine() captures the entire input line as a String.

Advantages of BufferedReader
✔ Efficient: Reads larger chunks of data at once, reducing I/O overhead.
✔ Flexible: Can read from files, console, or any input stream.
✔ Thread-safe: Can be synchronized if needed.


FileReader and InputStreamReader
Both FileReader and InputStreamReader are classes in the java.io package that are used to read data from files or other input streams. However, there are differences in their usage and underlying mechanisms.
FileReader
Purpose: Specifically used to read characters from files.
Internals: It is a character stream that makes reading character files easier.
Encoding: It assumes the default character encoding of the system, which can cause issues if you need to handle non-default encodings.
Constructor:
FileReader(String fileName) throws FileNotFoundException
FileReader(File file) throws FileNotFoundException

Example:
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;

public class FileReaderExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (FileReader fr = new FileReader("example.txt")) {
            int i;
            while ((i = fr.read()) != -1) {
                System.out.print((char) i);  // Reads and prints the file's characters
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}


Key Points of FileReader:
Efficient for reading text files.
Character stream: Reads data as characters, so it’s ideal for text-based files (e.g., .txt, .xml).
Not flexible for binary streams (like images, audio files).

InputStreamReader
Purpose: Converts byte streams into character streams, making it useful when dealing with input streams (like reading from a file or network socket) that provide byte data.
Internals: It is a bridge between byte streams and character streams, and it can be used with any InputStream (e.g., FileInputStream, BufferedInputStream).
Encoding: Allows specifying the character encoding (e.g., UTF-8, ISO-8859-1), which makes it more flexible than FileReader.
Constructor:
InputStreamReader(InputStream in) throws UnsupportedEncodingException
InputStreamReader(InputStream in, String encoding) throws UnsupportedEncodingException

Example:
import java.io.FileInputStream;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;
import java.io.IOException;

public class InputStreamReaderExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (InputStreamReader isr = new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream("example.txt"), "UTF-8")) {
            int i;
            while ((i = isr.read()) != -1) {
                System.out.print((char) i);  // Reads the characters from the file with specified encoding
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {

import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;

public class FileReaderExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (FileReader fr = new FileReader("example.txt")) {
            int i;
            while ((i = fr.read()) != -1) {
                System.out.print((char) i);  // Reads and prints the file's characters
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}


Key Points of FileReader:
Efficient for reading text files.
Character stream: Reads data as characters, so it’s ideal for text-based files (e.g., .txt, .xml).
Not flexible for binary streams (like images, audio files).

InputStreamReader
Purpose: Converts byte streams into character streams, making it useful when dealing with input streams (like reading from a file or network socket) that provide byte data.
Internals: It is a bridge between byte streams and character streams, and it can be used with any InputStream (e.g., FileInputStream, BufferedInputStream).
Encoding: Allows specifying the character encoding (e.g., UTF-8, ISO-8859-1), which makes it more flexible than FileReader.
Constructor:
InputStreamReader(InputStream in) throws UnsupportedEncodingException
InputStreamReader(InputStream in, String encoding) throws UnsupportedEncodingException

Example:
import java.io.FileInputStream;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;
import java.io.IOException;

public class InputStreamReaderExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (InputStreamReader isr = new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream("example.txt"), "UTF-8")) {
            int i;
            while ((i = isr.read()) != -1) {
                System.out.print((char) i);  // Reads the characters from the file with specified encoding
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}

Key Points of InputStreamReader:
Converts byte streams to character streams.
You can specify the character encoding when reading data (e.g., UTF-8).
More flexible than FileReader, as it can be used with any InputStream.

Comparison: FileReader vs InputStreamReader
Feature
FileReader
InputStreamReader
Purpose
Reads characters from files
Converts byte stream to character stream
Input Type
Directly reads from files
Works with any InputStream (e.g., files, sockets)
Encoding
Uses system default encoding
Can specify custom encoding (e.g., UTF-8)
Flexibility
Limited to file-based character streams
More flexible, works with byte streams
Usage
Best for text files in the default encoding
Best when you need control over encoding or work with various input sources


Which One to Use?
Use FileReader when reading from text files and the system's default encoding is sufficient.
Use InputStreamReader when:
You need to read from byte streams (e.g., FileInputStream, network streams).
You need to specify a custom encoding (e.g., UTF-8 or UTF-16).
